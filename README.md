# Capstone Project for Distributed Systems

Building a complete system that meets all functional requirements and is technically sound is a challenging, multifaceted, and iterative process which requires one to bring to bear all that he has learned throughout his C.S. education.

Under the supervision of faculty, **students will complete a realistic software engineering project that solves a real-world problem and meets or exceeds all relevant functional and technical criteria.**

While existing libraries, APIs, etc., may be used for most parts of the system, **the project must include independently solving, originally in oneâ€™s own code, a non-trivial distributed systems challenge.**
