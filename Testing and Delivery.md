# Testing and Delivery

## Formalize Test Requirements

- Generating a test specification with list of unit tests needed to cover each supported use cases
- Test cases should account for 100% code and data coverage.
- List  test cases along with expected and actual results.

## Testing and Monitoring

- Generate test reports showing tests that have passed and the list of defects found by running the tests.
- When defects have been addressed, generate successful test reports
- Document instructions for starting and stopping components and recovering from failures.
- Demonstrate proper monitoring is in place by simulating outages and demonstrating proper notification or automated recovery

## Delivery and Presentation

Each project must result in a public GitHub repo which will include the below deliverables:

- Source code, build scripts, and tests (and data, if applicable)
- A PowerPoint overview presentation of the project
- A PDF document explaining the system’s requirements, features, architecture, key technical challenges and solutions. Should be written such that any skilled software engineer can understand it, even if he is not an expert in distributed systems.
- Two “getting started” guides: one for users of the system and one for developers who would want to improve/extend their system.
- Deploy the above in GitHub a summary and links in the Readme.md file
